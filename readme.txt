Have Konto create an electronic invoice and deliver a PDF to your customer's inbox and a payment claim to their eBank.

== Description ==

In the checkout process, the customer can choose to get an electronic invoice (PDF) sent to their inbox and for the invoice to appear in their eBank - where they make their payment.

Konto users will have Konto automatically generate an invoice and bill their customers in their respective eBank. Konto provides connections to bookkeeping applications like Navision and makes it easy to generate a legit invoice, bill customers, monitor payment and book the transaction in your choice of accounting solutions.

Note: The plugin requires that Konto users have an API key.
